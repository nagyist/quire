# Quire Code of Conduct
 
Version 2.0 (October 10, 2022)

**All are welcome**. As an open-source community, Quire is committed to providing a safe, welcoming, transparent, and inclusive environment for all our community members and those wishing to become involved. We value diverse perspectives and invite participation at all levels of experience or expertise. 

Our Code of Conduct provides guidance to help foster friendly and respectful interactions and outlines the consequences for anyone found in violation of our community values. Our Code of Conduct applies across  all Quire-related communication platforms including the GitHub Discussions forum, GitHub repositories, the Quire email list, and any private correspondence. It also applies to remote and in- person meetings, events, conferences, and any instances in which a community member represents    Quire out in the world. We strive to maintain a positive, collaborative, and enriching experience for our community. To help us reach this goal, we ask that all community members adhere to the following guidelines for participation.

If you believe that someone is violating the Quire Code of Conduct, we ask that you please report this behavior immediately by emailing [quire@getty.edu](quire@getty.edu). For more information, please see our [Reporting Guidelines](#reporting-guidelines) below.

## QUIRE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES	

**We are friendly and patient**: We encourage our community to connect, engage, and support one another. Members may not participate in sustained disruptions of the communications of others. 

**We are welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.  Discriminatory, threatening, and exclusionary behavior, images, and language are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

**We are considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re an international community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.

**We are respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.  Respect other’s privacy. In general, if someone asks you stop a behavior or interaction, then stop.

**We are careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other community members for any reason. 

**We try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err,  and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. 

## REPORTING GUIDELINES	

We encourage members of the Quire community to resolve issues on their own whenever possible.  If you believe that the Quire Code of Conduct is being violated and you are unable to resolve the issue, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting the Quire project team at: [quire@getty.edu](quire@getty.edu). Your report will be addressed as soon as possible. 

All reports will be handled with discretion.  In your report please include:

- Your contact info (so we can contact you if necessary).
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses, please try to note them as well.
- Your account of what occurred and any supporting evidence or additional context.  
- Any other information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, the Quire project team will contact you to review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.  Parties involved in the report are never part of the team reviewing the alleged violation.  Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.  If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the Quire project team may take any action they deem appropriate as a consequence, up to and including a permanent ban from the community forum or repositories.
